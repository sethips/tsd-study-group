- [Matlab videos on Kalman Filters](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/understanding-kalman-filters-part-1-why-use-kalman-filters--1485813028675.html) Discover common uses of Kalman filters by walking through some examples. A Kalman filter is an optimal estimation algorithm used to estimate states of a system from indirect and uncertain measurements.


  -[Wikipedia on Kalman Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) In statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.
